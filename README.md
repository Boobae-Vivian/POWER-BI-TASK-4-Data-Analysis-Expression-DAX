# DATA ANALYSIS EXPRESSIONS(DAX) ON BANK FULL DISTRIBUTION DATASET

## INTRODUCTION

In this data-driven exploration of the 'Bank Full Distribution' dataset, we will embark on a comprehensive journey to extract meaningful insights and enhance the dataset's analytical capabilities using advanced data analysis techniques. Our focus lies on implementing various data manipulation and calculation techniques to generate valuable metrics and classifications. The primary objectives include establishing a measure for the 'Average Age of Depositors,' introducing a new column denoting 'Age Band' to categorize depositors by age groups, and creating measures to assess the total balance specific to certain demographic criteria, such as occupation and marital status. Furthermore, we aim to quantify the number of depositors with active loans, employing the power of data analysis expressions. Through these tasks, we aim to uncover patterns, trends, and relevant information that can contribute to a more informed understanding of the dataset and support strategic decision-making processes.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

The task at hand revolves around a comprehensive analysis of the 'Bank Full Distribution' dataset. The specific challenges to address include to:

1. Develop a measure to calculate the average age of depositors.
2. Introduce a new column named 'Age Band' with the following categories:
   - 'Young' for ages below 30
   - 'Mid-aged' for ages between 30 and 50
   - 'Old' for ages above 50
3. Create a measure calculating the total balance for depositors with the following criteria:
   - Job: Technician
   - Marital: Single and Married
4. Formulate a measure to determine the number of depositors with active loans.

Successfully addressing these challenges will contribute to a richer understanding of the dataset, unveiling patterns, trends, and relevant information crucial for informed decision-making in strategic and operational contexts.
